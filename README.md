# OpenGL Picnic Table
Second Homework for Interactive Computer Graphics

I used Microsoft Visual Studio 2019 with directory links to the freeglut Include PATHs and libraries. I also included freeglut.dll in my homework's x64 folder. This homework can be compiled via the debugger in Visual Studio 2019 - view each different image by changing curProblem = 1 through 4 for whatever image you want to view.

I greatly enjoyed completing this project. For the open-ended portion, I constructed a gazebo with a table, four chairs rendered via a nested glPushMatrix(), and a center piece directly rendered via its coordinates. I am happy with the way that my final image turned out and I look forward to rendering more complex images in the future.

Please let me know if you have any problems compiling or displaying any of my images.
